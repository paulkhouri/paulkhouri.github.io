<br>
You should create a functions for:
<ul>
<li>A Rectangle</li> 
<li>A Circle</li> 
<li>Drawing a line between two points</li>
<li>Writing text on the screen</li> 
<li>An ellipse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="functions/functions_rotation.html"> Functions and rotation </a></li>
<li> <a href="functions/functions1.html"> Another functions sheet </a><br>
    This one just has some other examples - please note that the code may not be <u> exactly </u> 
    the same as what we have done in class. <br>
It is also worth noting that there is a more extended code block at the top, this is just a copy-pasted
piece that is doing what? </li>
<li><a href="functionsclass/functionclass.html"> Rectangle with a circle inside </a></li>
To make this function, problems arise if negative values are entered as width and height.<br>
Later on you will need to realise that this can happen and the kind of problems that can arise<br>
This one if fixed so it will always work for any width and height inputs
<li><a href= "gradients/gradients.html">Looking at Gradients (this is a bit of extension) </a> </li>
<li><a href= "loops/functions_loops.html">Loops file with slightly different function structure</a> </li>
<li><a href= "loops/functions_loops_complex.html">More complex loops as these have been combined with rotations</a> </li>
<hr>
<li><a href="objects/rectangleobject.html"> Rectangle Object </a></li>
Basic rectangle object. Please note the array structure used to update the object.
<li><a href="objects/objects.html"> Five Dot Square Object </a></li>
Object with a more complicated drawing and a built in circle function,
lots of useful stuff in this one.
<hr>
<li><a href="animation/animation.html"> a set of animated objects </a></li>
The two differences here is that the update inside the object will change a value (an x or something like that).
Every time the update is called the value changes.<br>
In the main js file there is a new function called animate. This now runs in a loop in real time. 
It runs about 40 times per second.<br> 
Every time it loops it erases the entire canvas and re-draws all the objects (though their update).<br>
Because the a variable ( like x ) has changed, the object appears in a different position and we have 
the illusion of movement because the changes happen very quickly.<br>
The counters should give you an idea of how quickly the animation loop is running.
<hr>
<li><a href="interaction/interaction_base.html"> Interaction Base </a></li>
This canvas is blank but if you open the console and click the mouse on the canvas, 
you will observe that "mousedown", "mouseup", and "mousemove" events are being registered.<br>
The basic animation loop is in the main js but serves no purpose at this stage.<br>
The mouse events are being registered by the "listener" codes that have been put inside the object<br>
The listener must be attached to an HTML element (in this case the canvas).<br>
 Note that the canvas connection variable itself has been passed as a parameter.
 <li><a href="interaction/interaction.html"> Interaction with dragged out rectangle </a></li>
 This now integrates the animation frame with the listeners (and an object). <br>
 Click and drag on the canvas.
 <li><a href="interaction/interaction_square.html"> Interaction with dragged out rectangle and a contained square </a></li>
This is virtually identical to the previous example. <br>
The only difference is that a square is drawn inside the rectangle as well<br>
It would be very helpful to try to solve this problem without looking at the code<br>
Or have a look and then try on your own.<br>
If you do try on your own and drag in different directions you 
should find that there is a small but tricky problem that needs to be solved.
<li><a href="interaction/interaction_push.html"> Draw a rectangle </a></li>
Each click and drag leaves a rectangle drawn on the canvas<br>
It should be noted at this stage, that we have the beginnings of a simple drawing program<br>
Note that the Rectangle class is called from within the control object.<br>
It is not great practice to do this without actually passing the class as a parameter<br>
We could have done this but we do want to consider that we may be dealing with lots of classes <br>
 and may need to manage things with more sophistaction later on. So this solution is fine for now<br>
 In Javascript a class is accessible from anywhere.
 <hr>
 <li><a href="dragpoints/dpoints.html"> Dragging Points </a></li>
 Click and drag on the points. (the Rectangles are extensions of the point idea)
 <li><a href="dragpoints_inherit/dpointsinherit.html"> Dragging Things </a></li>
This is the same idea, but it does have a new coding structure. <br>
We may start using this later.
